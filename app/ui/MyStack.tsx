            <h2>My Stack</h2>

            <p><b>Frontend Development •</b> I use <span>React</span> with frameworks like <span>Next.js</span> to
                build fast, SEO-friendly
                applications. I choose Next.js because of their focus on top DX while also being able to provide great
                user experience with tech like SSR. For styling I prefer <span>TailwindCSS</span> for my personal projects, but I
                also
                use <span>MUI</span> or similar UI libraries for larger projects with
                traditional <span>HTML/CSS</span>.
            </p>

            <p><b>Backend Development & Databases •</b> I rely on <span>Node.js</span> and work with both REST and
                GraphQL APIs. Depending on the needs, I use
                relational databases like <span>PostgreSQL</span> or <span>Google Cloud SQL</span> and NoSQL solutions
                like <span>MongoDB</span>, <span>Firebase</span>, and <span>Supabase</span>. <span>Redis</span> helps
                with caching and session management.
            </p>


            <p><b>Architecture & System Design •</b> I design event-driven architectures using tools
                like <span>Kafka</span> or <span>AWS SNS/SQS</span>, and
                use microservices when appropriate to ensure scalability and maintainability.
            </p>


            <p><b>Authentication & Authorization •</b> I prefer to handle authentication
                with <span>OAuth</span> with a service like <span>Okta</span>. I believe platforms should always offer
                SSO since it offers the best UX.
            </p>


            <p><b>Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps •</b> I use <span>Docker</span> for containerization
                and <span>Terraform</span> for infrastructure-as-code. My
                cloud stack includes <span>GCP</span>, <span>AWS</span>, and <span>Vercel</span>, with CI/CD pipelines
                through <span>GitHub Actions</span> to
                streamline deployment.
            </p>


            <p><b>Testing & Quality Assurance •</b> I write tests
                with <span>Jest</span>, <span>Cypress</span>, <span>Playwright</span>,
                and <span>Cucumber</span> to ensure code reliability and performance. I am a proponent for integration
                tests in general, while I do think unit tests are applicable for pure functions.
            </p>


            <p><b>Code Quality & Version Control •</b> I maintain consistent code style
                using <span>ESLint</span> and <span>Prettier</span>, and manage code
                versions with <span>Git</span>. As long as the style conventions are consistent within a project, then I
                am happy.
            </p>
